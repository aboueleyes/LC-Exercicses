# How to Recursively Change the File's Permissions in Linux

## Chmod Recursive
The `chmod` command allows you to change the permissions of files using `symbolic` or `numeric` mode

To recursively operate on all files and directories under a given directory, use the chmod command with the `-R`, (`--recursive`) option. 
The general syntax to recursively change the fileâ€™s permissions is as follows:

```bash
chmod -R MODE DIRECTORY
```
 For example, to change the permissions of all files and subdirectories under the `/var/www/html` directory to `755` you would use:
```bash 
$ chmod -R 755 /var/www/html
```
